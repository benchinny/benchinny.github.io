In a well-known visual illusion, a rhombus shape moving side-to-side appears to be moving diagonally when it is at low contrast. This is thought to arise from a 'slow-speed prior' in the human visual system--a bias towards perceiving motion as slower than it actually is. We examined the extent to which this motion illusion occurred in a small sample of patients with low vision.

We found that while participants with typical vision experienced the illusion strongly at low contrast, only some participants with low vision experienced it.
