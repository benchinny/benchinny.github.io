I'm an incoming assistant professor at the <a href="https://www.rit.edu/science/chester-f-carlson-center-imaging-science">Chester F. Carlson Center for Imaging Science</a> at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). I'll be starting this position July 1st, 2025, and am currently wrapping up a postdoc at UC Berkeley in the lab of <a href="https://www.emilyacooper.org/">Dr. Emily Cooper</a>. 

I am actively looking for graduates students and a postdoc--if you are looking for a lab to join, consider learning more about my research to decide whether we might be a good fit! 

In my new lab, I plan to study visuomotor behavior in human beings. I am particularly interested in visual accommodation, which refers to the act of focusing the lens in the eyeball. I am also interested in hand-eye coordination during manual tracking of moving objects. 

You may reach me via email at bechin [AT] berkeley [DOT] edu.
